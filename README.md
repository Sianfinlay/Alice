# RehabStudio Tech Exercise - Fix the Looking Glass
__Current Idea:__ Alice in Wonderland theme, Player must fix the 'Looking Glass' by putting the mirror sharps back to show an image of wonderland.

This deviates from the original Alice in wonderland novel by which the environment shown in the looking glass is not Alice's home.
##Task:
You must develop a simple jigsaw puzzle game using JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. The game should be a single-page application, with two sections/views:
The first section (homepage) should contain a summary of how to play the game, with a button to begin playing.
The second section should show the game itself. The game should display the jumbled-up pieces of an image. The player must arrange the jumbled up pieces correctly to complete the puzzle. When all the pieces of the image have been placed correctly, the player should be notified that they have won.

### Notes:
- The test is designed to evaluate code competency, style and problem solving skills.
- Feel free to add a bit of flair or CSS magic to make the game look nice or more fun to play.
- You must use Backbone, Angular or React as the core framework of the application, if you choose to use one (you don't have to).
- You may use additional libraries (e.g. jQuery) as part of the test.
- If you wish to preprocess your CSS, please use SASS or SCSS.
- Use code comments to explain your reasoning behind your solution, and clearly explain any assumptions you have made.
All files should be bundled in a ZIP file along with a README containing your name, contact info, and instructions for running the application.
